The students will build a simple command-line-based "Task Manager" where users can create, view, update, and delete tasks.

Features:
The user can input a task description and add it to a list of tasks.
Display all tasks with their respective IDs and statuses (whether they are completed or not).
The user can select a task by its ID and toggle its completion status.
The user can remove a task from the list.
The user can update the description of an existing task.
Allow users to search for tasks by name using filter or find methods.
